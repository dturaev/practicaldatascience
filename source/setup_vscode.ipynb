    "One tool you will find incredibly helpful in your career as a data scientist is a good text editor designed to work with plain text files (files that just contain simple text, but no fancy formatting like a Microsoft Word document or a PDF). You've probably seen a simple version of this type of editor before (Notepad on Windows, or TextEdit on macs), but is really useful to install a more robust text editor instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose I'm going to recommend Visual Studio Code (better known as VSCode). It's a Microsoft project, but it's open source and in addition to being an easy way to edit plaintext files comes with a lot of packages for adding extra functionality. VSCode is definitely not the only good text editor out there, and you'll find that people have very strong opinions about which one to use (some people swear by in-terminal editors like eMacs, or Vim), and personally I used to rely on Atom (since github -- which developed Atom -- was bought by Microsoft, it looks like a lot of the development energy has moved over to VSCode, so I think that's a better place to go now...). If you already have one of these and like it, please feel free to stick with it!\n",
    "\n",
    "So before we install Python, please follow the directions below to install VSCode if you don't already have a good text editor."
