    "1. Along the top of your notebook, select \"Export\" (it might be in the three-dot menu).\n",
    "2. Choose \"HTML\" and **save it next to this notebook file**. This is important because any images in the HTML have relative file paths that are set up to be in reference to the location of your notebook, so if you save it somewhere else, when you open it you may lose all your images. \n",
    "3. Open that HTML in your normal web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc), **not** in VS Code.\n",
    "4. Print the page to PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do this instead of choosing the PDF option when exporting? If you try and export a notebook directly to PDF, VS Code will actually try and use a tool to convert it to a LaTeX document, compile that latex document, then print, and getting this setup right can be a pain, and the LaTeX conversion often causes problems. So while a little convoluted, that's my recommendation. \n",
    "\n",
    "With that said, if you like LaTeX (and have it installed), go ahead and export directly to PDF and see if you like the result! **Just be sure to initially save the PDF next to the notebook file,** as the same issue with relative paths affects LaTeX as HTML files. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have a PDF, please upload it to Gradescope!"
