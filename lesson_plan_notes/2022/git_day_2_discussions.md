Data structures:

- Lists:
  - ordered collections
- Set:
  - UNordered collections, no duplicates
- Dict:
  - Unordered, all have identifiers

How would you find something?

Order
... you don't? Can check if already exists though.
By key (label)

- Tuples
  - Immutable. A bundle of things not meant to ever be modified.

=======

- VS Code git integration:
  - Use it to look at file changes, maybe revert
  - don't get TOO dependent on it

- Format notebooks
