    "Welcome to the MIDS summer 2020 Python module! This collection of resources is designed to ensure that everyone has a common basic familiarity with Python before the start of courses this fall. \n",
    "\n",
    "We know many of you still have outside commitments, so we're providing you lots of time to complete this module: you have until June 21st to complete all assigned modules and pass the Python Module Exam. Also, **please note that you MUST enroll in DataCamp within the next week and a half.** If you do not, you will have to pay for your own DataCamp account. Directions for enrolling should have been in the email you received about Python Review, and are repeated below. "

    "\n",
    "For this module, we'll be using DataCamp -- an excellent tool for developing familiarity with various programming tools. Rather than just *reading* about these tools, DataCamp involves lots of active learning opportunities. Moreover, DataCamp offers free accounts for academic groups, and so once you enroll you will not only have access to the modules we require, but also the entire DataCamp catalogue if you wish to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you create an account, you should see four Python assignments waiting: \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Introduction to Python* course\n",
    "- *Intermediate Python* course\n",
    "- The *Data Ingestion and Inspection* chapter from *Pandas Foundations*\n",
    "- The *Exploratory Data Analysis* chapter from *Pandas Foundations*"

    "## What if I already know Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you've worked with Python before, there may still be material in these courses that will be new to you, especially if the primary way you learned Python was through a CS class. That's because the way Python is used in Data Science is different from how it's used in many other domains. In particular, this Python Module includes lessons on two packages that are absolutely critical to data science (and your MIDS courses): a library called `numpy` and a library called `pandas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've worked with Python a lot in the past (e.g. you can write loops and functions, and know about variable types) but not numpy and pandas, feel free to skip over the material in the courses that's familiar and just do the portions on the libraries you've never seen. You'll find numpy is used from Introduction to Python Section 4 forward, and pandas is used starting with Intermediate Python for Data Science, Section 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think you're prepared to completely skip this section, please take the \"Module Exam\" discussed below. If you score a 86% or above, you may skip the DataCamp content. Otherwise, please complete the DataCamp content in this course."

    "## Additional Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're an eager beaver and want some supplementary materials on Python, here are a couple great resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Intro to Python for Data Science](https://github.com/kylebradbury/python), a full set of Python tutorials by your future Machine Learning instructor, Kyle Bradbury.\n",
    "- [Python for Data Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython-dp-1491957662/dp/1491957662/), a great book by one of the chief architects of the key data science libraries for Python. This book is light on training in python itself, but great for numpy and pandas. It will be strongly recommended in one of MIDS elective courses. *Make sure to get the Second Edition!* pandas has changed a lot since the first edition. \n",
    "- [Pandas for Everyone](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0134546938/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1): A new, excellent book about numpy and pandas. "

    "## Getting Help\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have questions about the module materials, please post questions in [Piazza Q&A](https://piazza.com/class/kar0ztzvl7s71r).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Piazza is designed for students to respond to other students, with input from instructors when needed. \n",
    "    - When you post a question, be sure to \"tag\" it with the module it relates to (see the small blue buttons near the top of the Piazza window, such as \"python,\" \"stats,\" and \"general\").\n",
    "    - You should check Piazza periodically during each module and respond to questions from your peers, if you know the answer. You may also edit and improve answers posted by other students.\n",
    "    - The instructors will check Piazza periodically, respond to open questions, and verify student responses. \n",
    "    - Remember: you should not ask for (nor give other students) the exact answers to any of the graded quiz or exam questions in Piazza. Doing so will not ensure you, or your classmates, are prepared for your fall courses.  We certainly want you to help each other, but it is critical that you finish the online review confident in your own mastery of the material. \n",
    "- If you have questions of a more personal or private nature, which you would not feel comfortable posting to the class Piazza forums, please direct the Piazza question only to the instructors (when creating a new post, choose Post to: Instructor(s) ).\n",
    "\n",
    "I will also be holding optional live, real-time \"office hours\" (online help sessions). These sessions will NOT be required; they are opportunities for students to get help, if students would like to talk directly to the instructor and other students. These sessions will be held in Zoom. To participate, you will need a computer with a reliable internet connection, headset with microphone (a microphone built into your computer may also work), and ideally a web camera. Prior to joining your first Zoom session, you should test your Zoom set up (you know... in case some how you haven't spent the last 3 months living on Zoom like the rest of us ;P). \n",
    "\n",
    "I'll be holding office hours every Friday from 10am - 11am EST (sorry Californians -- this time is the best compromise to accomodate people in China and India). If you need to talk but can't make this time, please send me an email at [nick@nickeubank.com](mailto:nick@nickeubank.com) and we'll figure something out. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to come to office hours, please sign up **at least 24 hours in advance** [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUxHSUNEUDdBU2R0fGRlZmF1bHR8NTc4ZTM1NTRlZmNiZjVjOTZiNmFmYWI5MTljZGY2ZTE)."

    "## Enrolling in DataCamp\n",

    "\n",
    "- Enroll using that linke **and the email address that invite was sent to**\n",
    "- Follow [this link](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/shared_links/52f8c4b1220a1925828f7d027e949a203a4a4e01227060416df64c9cabeb536d) and create a DataCamp account **using a gmail email address.**\n",
    "\n",
    "I recognize it's weird we're asking you to use a gmail address, but DataCamp requires us to specify a single email domain for all class signups, and because of Covid not all students have been able to get all the paperwork they need to finalize their matriculation to Duke, and as a result they can't get Duke email addresses yet. So we've chosen gmail since even if you don't have a gmail account already, you can create one for free!"
